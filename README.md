# Dinosaurs Roamed

A basic emulation of a card game that my wife and I made up for late nights.

I built this to re-introduce myself to Ruby after spending several years deep in Python.

It was a bit of an experience changing syntax.

Its a basic console app that will give you some options, take some input, and keep track of score.

The scoring mechanism is fairly simple, and found in ```compare_cards```.
